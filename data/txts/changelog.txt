0.6
- The package now includes the changelog.
- Support for kidsobjdb files (Note: kidsobjdb files are converted to .xml). Important: the file master.bin is needed when converting kidsobjdb to xml, otherwhise the xml will be very cryptic.
- Added the .bat "fid_utility_sort.bat". This .bat is only meaningful for kidsobjdb. It will cause the converted xml to have its objects ordered by name (only the objects will be ordered, not the columns), which
  is useful when comparing .kidsobjdb of the same kind (like Envs files of stages).
- Partial support for .oid files (binary .oid files will be converted to .txt, but the reverse conversor is not yet implemented)

0.5
- Dictionary increased (included remaining Tamaki materials) 

0.4
- Added a second exe, "fid_utility_full.exe". This one can do a full string crack when converting from binary to text, instead of a crack based on current filename. 

0.3
- Increased dictionary for the cracking. 

0.2
- Added support for KTID files.
- Fixed: mtl files of broken costumes (and also black christmas bass) would fail in the cracking of strings.
- Instead of using dummy names like "MAT000", "MAT001", etc when failing the crack, it will now use names like "HASH_(hash)", so that the txt to binary can get the proper hash in these cases aswell. 

0.1
